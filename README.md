# Repeating impacts on Society
Course name is Computer science A. This course is a elective program implented at Robert Peary middle School to provide students the access to computer science topics, skills, and knowledge. This course will be for 7th and 8th grade students. The course will be in time period of 10 weeks. The school has reduced a semester long of curriculum to 10 weeks for every content. Students will go through a series of programs and students will reflect on how these programs taught in this course impact society. The programs in this course are such as but not limited to Tinkercad, scratch, Arduino, and python coding.  

## Plan

### Learning Objectives
Students will relate the programs used in the course to compare to real life and how these programs impact society.

### Learning Activities
Students will work on following topics for the following weeks. 
After students complete these lessons of each program being introduced to students students will answer and reflect on the following question: 

How would you compare the different parts of (insert program taught below) and how they impact society? 

What are the pros and cons of this program  and the impact in society?

- Week 1-3 Learning about [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu)
- Week 4-6 [Tinkercad Circuits](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/fFl30RMLP3m-fantabulous-habbi-borwo/editel?tenant=circuits)
- Week 7-9 [Arduino](https://cloud.arduino.cc/)
- Week 10 [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) 

Students will have to discuss in group of 4. In a Kagan strategy called round robin. Students will have 45 seconds or less to share out in chronological order to each member of their group while others are listening. The audience will be able to discuss the person's response. They will give constructive feedback on and add on to that person's thoughts. This will benefit students to further reflect and modify their responses. 

### Assessment

Students will be assessed based on response.

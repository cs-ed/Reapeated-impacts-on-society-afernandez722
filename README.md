# Repeating impacts on Society
Course name is Computer Science Intro. This course is a elective program implented at Robert Peary middle School to provide students the access to computer science topics, skills, and knowledge. This course will be for 7th and 8th grade students. The course will be in time period of 10 weeks. The school has reduced a semester long of curriculum to 10 weeks for every content. Students will go through a series of programs and students will reflect on how these programs taught in this course impact society. The programs in this course are such as but not limited to Tinkercad, Scratch, Arduino, and Python coding.  

## Plan

### Learning Objectives
Students will relate the programs used in the course to compare to real life and how these programs impact society.

### Learning Activities
Students will work on following topics for the following weeks. 
After students complete these lessons of each program being introduced to students students will answer and reflect on the following question: 

**How would you compare the different parts of (insert program taught below) and how they impact society? 

**What are the pros and cons of this program  and the impact in society?

- Week 1-3 Learning about [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) Students will complete projects provided by Scratch with student's remix. Anticipation of students connecting Scratch programming to games making, story telling, and much more.
- Week 4-6 [Tinkercad Circuits](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/fFl30RMLP3m-fantabulous-habbi-borwo/editel?tenant=circuits) Students will go through series of lessons provided by TinkerCad going over circuits in a virtual manner. Anticipation that students can see the many uses virtual online 3D programs can connect to animation, model simuation, and much more.
- Week 7-9 [Arduino](https://cloud.arduino.cc/) Students will then apply what they have learned from Tinkercad to physical form of circuits using Arduinos. Anticipation that students can connect this program to every day use of LCD monitors, motors in many technology devices, and much more.
- Week 10 [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) Students will go through a series of lessons through CodeAcademy to learn to code using Python. Anticipation that students can make connection to data use from social media, websites, and so much more connections.

Students will have time to write in their composition notebook reflection to the questions above. Then, they will be given time to discuss in group of 4 their written responses. In a Kagan strategy called round robin. Where students will go around and share. Students will have 45 seconds or less to share out in chronological order to each member of their group while others are listening. The students who are listening will be able to discuss the person's response. They will give constructive feedback on and add on to that person's thoughts. This will benefit students to further reflect and modify their responses. 

### Assessment

Students will be assessed based on response based on the rubric below.

| 4           | 3           | 2            | 1           |
| ---:        | ---:        |  ---:        | ---:        |
| Student makes connection between the program in the course and its impacts on society. Provides examples and applies to program in course. Include pros and cons of program to society impact.|Students makes connection between program in course and its impacts in society. Attempts to provide examples with some explanation to connection. Include pros and cons to society impact.| Student attempts to make connection between program in course to its impact to society. Provides a few examples of connection betwee program and society impact. Provides a few pros and cons to society impact.| Student has challenges making connection between programs in the course and its impact on society.| 

### Outcomes

My plan will facilitate diversity but promoting student discussion in a smaller group setting. In this small group setting students can share their reflection on how programs being learned in computer science class are impacting them and everyone. Students are inclusive because the different goals in each task within the lessons can be achieve in different solutions. This can promote different responses to their reflection of how this connects with the real world and their own perspective. This will help in the long run because students are not given then chance to reflect on the content and how this information taught connects with their experiences which is within their society. Their life experiences maybe different than those to the person next to them and give them the chance to see how computer science connects us all together.

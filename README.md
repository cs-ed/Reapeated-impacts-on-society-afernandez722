# Repeating impacts on Society
Course name is Computer science A. This course is a elective program implented at Robert Peary middle School to provide students the access to computer science topics, skills, and knowledge. This course will be for 7th and 8th grade students. The course will be in time period of 10 weeks. The school has reduced a semester long of curriculum to 10 weeks for every content. Students will go through a series of programs and students will reflect on how these programs taught in this course impact society. The programs in this course are such as but not limited to Tinkercad, scratch, Arduino, and python coding.  

## Plan

### Learning Objectives
Students will relate the programs used in the course to compare to real life and how these programs impact society.

### Learning Activities
Students will work on these units for the following weeks. After students complete the units of each program being introduced to students students will answer the following question: How would you compare the different parts of (insert program taught below) and how they impact society? What are the pros and cons of this program  and the impact in society?
- Week 1-3 Learning about [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu)
- Week 4-6 [Tinkercad Circuits](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/fFl30RMLP3m-fantabulous-habbi-borwo/editel?tenant=circuits)
- Week 7-9 [Arduino](https://cloud.arduino.cc/)
- Week 10 [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) 

Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?

### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.

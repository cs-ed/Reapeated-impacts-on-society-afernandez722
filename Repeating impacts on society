# Impacts on Society
Course name is Computer science A. This course is a elective program implented at Robert Peary middle School to provide students the access to computer science topics, skills, and knowledge. This course will be for 7th and 8th grade students. Students will go through a series of programs and students will reflect on how these programs taught in this course impact society. The programs in this course are such as but not limited to Tinkercad, scratch, Arduino, and python coding.  

## Plan

### Learning Objectives
Students will relate the programs used in the course to compare to real life and how these programs impact society.

### Learning Activities
